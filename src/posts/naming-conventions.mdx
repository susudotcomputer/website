## Color Sets

A color set is a grouping of the variants of a core color. They are
graded going from 100 to 900, lightest to darkest respectively. The
system is designed to avoid the need to rename colors as shades are
added or removed.

A colors luminosity/saturation should be used to determine where on
the scale it should sit. A 100 color would be very close to
white/light grey with a tint of the core color in it. A 900 would be
nearly black with a tint of the core color in it and a 500 would be
characteristically the most vibrant and full version of the core
color.

Color sets are defined by the Design Team. As they need to be added
or removed they can do so at their discretion.

### Rules:

- The minimum number of colors in a color set is 1, the maximum is 9.
- All numbers should fall on hundreds, **100**, 300, 900 etc.
- Exception: Black and white are absolute colors which should never have variations. They are referred to by `black` and `white` when used in with color classes.

### Example:

```
.grey-500 { color: #DCDEDD }
.grey-400 { color: #E8E8E8 }
.grey-100 { color: #FBFBFA }
```

### Opacity modifiers:

In some cases we have transparent versions of variants in a color set. To denote this we use an underscore `_` after the color name followed by the percentage of transparency (e.g.`.bg-black_17 { background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.17)`)
